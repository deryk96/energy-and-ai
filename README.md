## About
This project investigates the energy consumption of generative AI usage and its impact on global power demands, focusing on data centers in the United States. We examined whether the growth in energy consumption from AI usage outpaces the adoption of green energy. Utilizing various datasets and visualization tools, the analysis addresses the energy demands of generative AI and potential sustainability challenges.

## Packages Used
Datasette: For quick exploration and querying of datasets.
Kaggle API: To retrieve and process large datasets.
Streamlit: For creating interactive visualizations, including power plant and data center maps.
Folium: For map-based visualizations.
Zippopotamus API: For ZIP code-based geographic correlation.
SERPAPI: To programmatically collect Google Trends data for generative AI interest.
